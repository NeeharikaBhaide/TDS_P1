1) Data scraping - I scraped the data from github api, appended it into a list and converted this list into a dataframe. Then while saving it I used the csv format.
    
2) Most Interesting fact found during analysis - I observed that the most popular languages in Austin is Javascript, second most popular language (among users who joined after 2020) is HTML but the language with highest average stars per repository is Fennel (which is not among the popular languages).

3) Recommendation for developers - To improve on the quality and skills in some of their existing repositories/projects, rather than creating new repositories/projects as the correlation between number of repositories and followers is very low that is increasing a single repository only increases approximately 4 followers (regression slope = 4.088) which is not very significant.
