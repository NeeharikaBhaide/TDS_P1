1) Data scraping - I scraped the data from github api for users in Austin who have more than 100 followers, performed data cleaning operations as instructed in the project document, appended cleaned data into a list, converted this list into a dataframe and stored it using csv format.
    
2) Most Interesting fact found during analysis - I observed that the most popular languages in Austin is Javascript, second most popular language (among users who joined after 2020) is HTML but the language with highest average stars per repository is Fennel (which is not among the popular languages).

3) Recommendation for developers - To improve on the quality and skills in some of their existing repositories/projects, rather than creating new repositories/projects as the correlation between number of repositories and followers is very low that is increasing a single repository only increases approximately 4 followers (regression slope = 4.088) which is not very significant.
